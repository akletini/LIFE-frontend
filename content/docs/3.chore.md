# Chore documentation

## What are chores?

`Chores` are reoccuring tasks that have a fixed interval on how often they have to be completed.

## How does the reoccurence work?

If a `chore` is not completed by its due date, the interval will be counted from the day of actual completion, not the due date. If a `chore` is completed before it's due date, the interval timing will depend on the "shift interval"-checkbox when creating/editing `chores`.
