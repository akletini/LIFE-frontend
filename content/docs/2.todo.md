# Todo documentation

## What are todos?

`Todos` are one time tasks that have a due date and an optional `tag`

## What are tags?

`Tags` are user defined labels to group `todos`. They can also be assigned a custom color. A `todo` can have exactly one tag.

## Anything else?

If you are logged in via your Google account, your `todos` can be synced with Google calendar/tasks.
